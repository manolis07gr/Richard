This is a shared github project between Dr. Manos Chatzopoulos and Richard
Tuminelo. MESA and SNEC models of SN explosions will be uploaded here. The
structure of the subfolders should be as follows:

XXMsun:
	XXMsunNOROTNOML
	XXMsunNOROTML
	XXMsunROT03ML
	XXMsunROT05ML
	XXMsunROT05MLNOMAG
	XXMsunROT09ML
	etc

We will similarly do 20, 25, 30, and 40 solar mass models.
